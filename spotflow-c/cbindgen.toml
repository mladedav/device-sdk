/**
 * Device SDK for Spotflow IoT Platform

/**
 * A client communicating with the Platform. This object is managed by the Device SDK. Create its instance
 * using @ref spotflow_client_start and delete it using @ref spotflow_client_destroy.
 *
 * The client stores all outgoing communication to the local database file and then sends it in a
 * background thread asynchronously. Thanks to that, it works even when the connection is unreliable.
 * Similarly, the client also stores all ingoing communication to the local database file and deletes it
 * only after the application processes it.

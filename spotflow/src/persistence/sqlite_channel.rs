//! This channel works like multiple producer single consumer channel but additionally persists data into a SQLite database and provides separate acknowledge functionality.
//! Separate acknowledgment turns the channel delivery guarantees into at-least-once instead of at-most-once. This does NOT imply exactly-once so some data may be delivered multiple times.
//! Acknowledgement can be done either through `Receiver` or through a separate `Acknowledger`.
//! To create a channel use `channel`, `Sender` is `Clone` if multiple producers are needed.

// To use this channel for d2c messages we would need to implement acknowledge last. Or the callsite would have to considerably change

/// This trait must be implemented by anything that wants to be sent/stored through the sqlite channel.
/// The implementation could be made much easier and less error-prone if we used an ORM but I don't want to do that right now because of other priorities and my lack of knowledge on that topic
/// Each object has to have a unique ID which is returned by the store operation. The objects are guaranteed to be returned in an ascending order during the run by a given instance.
/// If the channel is closed any unacknowledged messages will be delivered again starting from the lowest ID.
/// The store operations must create IDs higher than the last received value. This is trivially done by returning ascending series by using SQLite AUTOINCREMENT.
